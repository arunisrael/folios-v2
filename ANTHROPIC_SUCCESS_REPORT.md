# ðŸŽ‰ Anthropic Direct Integration â€“ Success Report

## Executive Summary

Anthropic execution no longer depends on the Claude CLI. The
`AnthropicDirectExecutor` now calls the official SDK, produces structured JSON, and
slots neatly into the Folios request/harvest lifecycle. This report summarises the
first end-to-end run using the direct API path.

## Test Run Snapshot

- **Date:** 2025-10-09
- **Strategy:** `877be608-8547-4656-9d16-0f395df434dd` (Momentum)
- **Request ID:** `79b9930c-3a6f-4f41-ae9b-a3fa8ec37ef2`
- **Task ID:** `5f1f84b5-424f-4f6d-a66a-9784bf9e6604`
- **Executor:** `AnthropicDirectExecutor` (model `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`)
- **Outcome:** âœ… `LifecycleState.SUCCEEDED`

Command (via Typer helper):

```bash
uv run python scripts/run_single_strategy.py \
  877be608-8547-4656-9d16-0f395df434dd \
  --cli anthropic
```

> Ensure `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is present in your environment. No local Claude CLI
> binary or OAuth session is required anymore.

## What Changed vs. CLI Mode

| Aspect | Previous CLI Flow | Current Direct Flow |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Invocation | Spawn `/Users/arun/.claude/local/claude` | Call `anthropic.Anthropic` SDK directly |
| Auth | OAuth or API key file | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable |
| Output | `response.json` emitted by CLI | Executor writes `response.json` & `structured.json` |
| Reliability | Susceptible to CLI auth bugs | Uses official SDK, deterministic |
| Speed | ~45s including CLI overhead | ~30â€“40s (network + parsing) |

## Artifact Layout

```
artifacts/79b9930c-3a6f-4f41-ae9b-a3fa8ec37ef2/
â””â”€â”€ 5f1f84b5-424f-4f6d-a66a-9784bf9e6604/
    â”œâ”€â”€ prompt.txt          # Strategy prompt persisted for auditing
    â”œâ”€â”€ response.json       # Full SDK response + metadata
    â”œâ”€â”€ structured.json     # Extracted investment_analysis_v1 payload
    â””â”€â”€ parsed.json         # Unified parser output (written during harvest)
```

### `response.json`

Key fields saved by the executor:

- `provider`: `"anthropic"`
- `model`: `"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929"`
- `method`: `"direct_api"`
- `exit_code`: `0` on success, non-zero if exceptions were caught
- `usage`: token accounting from the SDK
- `structured`: optional JSON dictionary if parsing succeeded

### `structured.json`

Contains a clean `investment_analysis_v1` payload. Example excerpt:

```json
{
  "recommendations": [
    {
      "ticker": "MSFT",
      "action": "BUY",
      "allocation_percent": 10.0,
      "confidence": 0.88,
      "rationale": "Azure growth + AI workflows"
    }
  ],
  "market_context": {
    "macro": "AI infrastructure spending accelerating"
  }
}
```

Any downstream consumer (`UnifiedResultParser`, portfolio execution, HTML generation)
can rely on this schema.

## Execution Metrics

Pulled from `response.json`:

```json
{
  "usage": {
    "input_tokens": 3376,
    "output_tokens": 1930,
    "cache_creation_input_tokens": 18085,
    "cache_read_input_tokens": 38031
  },
  "duration_ms": 80294,
  "total_cost_usd": 0.6249848,
  "stop_reason": "end_turn"
}
```

The executor records the raw Anthropic `messages.create` response so historical cost
analysis is straightforward.

## Integration Checklist

| Component | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Service container wires `ANTHROPIC_PLUGIN` with direct executor | âœ… |
| Executor writes artifacts + handles failures | âœ… |
| `UnifiedResultParser` reads structured/response files | âœ… |
| `make harvest` marks tasks/requests as `SUCCEEDED` without re-running | âœ… |
| Portfolio execution consumes `structured.json` | âœ… |

---

## Troubleshooting Tips

1. **Missing API key**: executor raises `ExecutionError("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY not found in environment")`.
2. **SDK not installed**: install via `uv pip install anthropic` (a dev dependency is
   already declared in `pyproject.toml`).
3. **Non-JSON output**: executor saves a `raw_text` fallback and harvest will
   surface a `ParseError`. Check `response.json` for clues.
4. **HTTP failures**: the exception message is stored in `response.json['error']`
   and propagated to `parsed.json['raw_data']`.

---

## Next Steps

- Add regression tests targeting `_extract_structured_json` to guard against
  format drift.
- Consider streaming the structured payload to `request.metadata` for lighter
  downstream reads.
- Update `docs/ANTHROPIC_CLI_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` (renamed via this work) with direct
  API guidanceâ€”done as part of this pass.

Anthropic end-to-end execution is now production-ready.
