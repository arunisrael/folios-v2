## Technical Implementation

### Scripts Created

2. **`scripts/parse_anthropic_recs_simple.py`** - Simplified recommendation parser

### Parsing Approach
- Multi-line format: `**TICKER (Company)** ... *Action:* BUY ... *Position Size:* X%`
- Single-line format: `**TICKER (Company)** - Description. BUY X%`
- Sub-bullet format: `* **TICKER (Company)** - Description. BUY X%`

### Database Schema
- **portfolio_accounts:** strategy_id, provider_id, payload (JSON with cash_balance, equity_value)
- **positions:** strategy_id, provider_id, symbol, status, payload (JSON with quantity, average_price, side)
- **orders:** strategy_id, provider_id, symbol, status, payload (JSON with action, quantity, limit_price)

---

## Recommendations for Future Execution

1. **Complete Remaining Strategies:** Execute the 9 parsed strategies that have not yet been applied to portfolios:
   - Benjamin Graham Strategy
   - Bill Ackman Strategy
   - Bill Ackman Turnaround Strategy
   - Bill Miller Strategy
   - Bruce Berkowitz Strategy
   - Carl Icahn Corporate Raider Strategy
   - Carl Icahn Strategy
   - Charlie Munger Quality Compounder Strategy
   - Classic Value + Insider Buying Strategy

2. **Handle Ticker Issues:**

   - BRK.B: Convert to BRK-B format for Yahoo Finance API

3. **Manual Strategies:**
   - Concentrated Value Portfolio and Contrarian Value Investing require manual parsing due to cross-references

4. **Monitoring:** Set up automated position tracking and P&L calculation using live market data
