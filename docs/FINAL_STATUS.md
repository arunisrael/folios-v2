# Final Implementation Status

**Date:** 2025-10-09

All critical pieces of the Folios v2 execution pipeline are operational. The
single-strategy orchestration script, harvest flow, and portfolio execution engine
have been validated against OpenAI, Gemini, and Anthropic providers.

---

## Status Snapshot

| Component | State | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| `scripts/run_single_strategy.py` | ✅ | Handles mixed batch + CLI/direct runs, emits request/task IDs. |
| `scripts/harvest.py` | ✅ | Parses batch downloads and existing CLI/direct artifacts without re-executing providers. |
| `scripts/execute_recommendations.py` | ✅ | Converts `structured.json` into orders/positions and updates portfolios. |
| Provider registry | ✅ | OpenAI + Gemini + Anthropic wired with throttles, serializers, executors, parsers. |
| Documentation | ✅ | Command reference, lifecycle walkthrough, onboarding guide updated. |

## Provider Readiness

### OpenAI
- Batch submissions reach `/v1/batches` with real API creds.
- Expect ~24h turnaround; simulator available when `OPENAI_API_KEY` is absent and
  `FOLIOS_LOCAL_BATCH_FALLBACK=1`.
- Action: schedule harvest runs after the completion window or automate via cron.

### Gemini
- CLI executor produces structured outputs immediately.
- Batch workflow (submit → poll → harvest) uses helper scripts in `scripts/`.
- Action: operationalise `test_gemini_submit.py` + `harvest_gemini_batches.py` for
  daily runs.

### Anthropic
- Direct API execution via `AnthropicDirectExecutor` creates `response.json` +
  `structured.json` in one pass.
- Requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`; no CLI binary needed.
- Token/cost telemetry saved for later analysis.

## Operational Checklist

1. `uv pip install -e .[dev]`
2. `make check`
3. `uv run python scripts/run_single_strategy.py <STRATEGY_ID> --batch openai --cli gemini,anthropic`
4. `make status`
5. `make harvest` (or Gemini-specific helpers for long jobs)
6. `uv run python scripts/execute_recommendations.py <REQUEST_ID> <STRATEGY_ID> --provider-id <PROVIDER>`
7. Verify portfolios via SQL (`portfolio_accounts`, `positions`, `orders`).

## Remaining Follow-Ups

1. **Testing:** Increase unit coverage for market data services, unified parser, and
   Anthropic executor (see `TEST_COVERAGE_ANALYSIS.md`).
2. **Batch automation:** Cron Gemini batch submission/harvest scripts; optionally
   add a Typer command wrapper for consistency with other tooling.
3. **Request lifecycle polish:** Consider marking CLI/direct requests as
   `succeeded` immediately in `run_single_strategy.py` once artifacts are written.
4. **Observability:** Add lightweight logging/metrics around batch polling and
   portfolio execution to aid future debugging.

The system is ready for production-style runs once provider credentials are in
place.
